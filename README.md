# CSI2132
**Description:** Final project assignment for my database design course at the University of Ottawa. I coded the UI and Phil designed the database.

Setup:
1. Navigate to CSI2132 directory
2. Run these commands in the terminal:   
a) go get -u github.com/lib/pq  
b) go get -u github.com/gorilla/mux  
c) go get -u github.com/gorilla/schema  
d) go get -u github.com/jinzhu/gorm  
e) go get -u golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt  
3. Enter: go run main.go in terminal  
4. Open browser and paste in http://localhost:8000/  


If you're on windows, it'll ask you for access.  
If that's the case, just "allow access".
